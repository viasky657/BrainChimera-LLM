# Integrating Grokking Optimizers with COCONUT

This guide shows how to integrate the optimizations from "Grokking at the Edge of Numerical Stability" into the COCONUT model to enable faster generalization.

## Overview

The paper identifies two key issues that delay generalization:

1. **Softmax Collapse (SC)**: Numerical instability in Softmax causing gradients to become zero
2. **Naïve Loss Minimization (NLM)**: Gradients aligning with weights causing delayed generalization

Our implementation provides two solutions:
- **StableMax/StableCrossEntropyLoss**: Replaces Softmax with a more stable function
- **OrthoAdamW/OrthoGrad**: Uses only the component of gradients orthogonal to weights

## Step-by-Step Integration

### 1. Import Required Modules

Add these imports to your training script:

```python
from GrokOptimizers import OrthoAdamW, StableCrossEntropyLoss
from coconut_grok_adapter import configure_coconut_for_grokking
```

### 2. Option 1: One-Line Integration

For the simplest integration, use the adapter function before training:

```python
# Assuming 'coconut_model' is your COCONUT model instance
coconut_model = configure_coconut_for_grokking(coconut_model, lr=1e-3, weight_decay=0.01)

# Then continue with your existing training code
```

### 3. Option 2: Replace Optimizer and Loss Function

Alternatively, replace the optimizer and loss function directly:

#### In the `apply_introspection_reward` method (around line 1956-1973)

Change:
```python
if not hasattr(self, 'optimizer'):
    self.optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=0.0001)
```

To:
```python
if not hasattr(self, 'optimizer'):
    self.optimizer = OrthoAdamW(self.parameters(), lr=0.0001, weight_decay=0.01)
```

#### In any training function that creates an optimizer

For example, in the CROW training section around line 3310-3320:

```python
trained_model, training_metrics = apply_crow_to_coconut(
    coconut_model=coconut_model,
    # ... other parameters ...
)
```

You can modify the `apply_crow_to_coconut` function to use OrthoAdamW instead of the default optimizer.

### 4. Replace Loss Functions

Find any occurrences of `CrossEntropyLoss` or similar loss functions and replace with `StableCrossEntropyLoss`.

Example of replacing loss function:

```python
# From:
criterion = CrossEntropyLoss()

# To:
criterion = StableCrossEntropyLoss()
```

### 5. Specific Locations to Modify

Based on the `COCONUTWLatentThinking.py` file, here are specific places to integrate these optimizers:

#### A. CoconutBinaryLatentModel.apply_introspection_reward (around line 1956-1973)

```python
def apply_introspection_reward(self, reward):
    # Scale the reward for gradient purposes
    scaled_reward = reward * 0.1
    
    # Create a reward tensor that requires gradients
    reward_tensor = torch.tensor(scaled_reward, requires_grad=True, device=next(self.parameters()).device)
    
    # Create an optimizer if one doesn't exist
    if not hasattr(self, 'optimizer'):
        # Change this line:
        # self.optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(self.parameters(), lr=0.0001)
        # To:
        self.optimizer = OrthoAdamW(self.parameters(), lr=0.0001, weight_decay=0.01)
    
    # Apply the reward as a loss (negative reward becomes positive loss)
    loss = -reward_tensor
    
    # Backward pass and optimization
    self.optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    self.optimizer.step()
```

#### B. Main Training Functions

The main training functions that might benefit from these optimizers include:

1. `run_introspection_training` (around line 3341)
2. `train_moral_empathy` (around line 3404)

### 6. Creating a Custom Wrapper for Existing Training Functions

If you don't want to modify the original code, you can create wrapper functions:

```python
def run_grokking_adapted_introspection_training(model, *args, **kwargs):
    """Run introspection training with grokking optimizations"""
    # Apply grokking optimizations first
    model = configure_coconut_for_grokking(model)
    
    # Then run the original training function
    return run_introspection_training(model, *args, **kwargs)
```

## Testing the Integration

After integrating these optimizations, you should observe:

1. Faster convergence to generalizable solutions
2. The ability to generalize without requiring heavy weight decay
3. More stable training (fewer NaN values or loss spikes)
4. Earlier "grokking" of patterns in the data

## Complete Implementation Example

For a complete working example, see the provided files:

- `GrokOptimizers.py`: Core implementations of StableMax and orthogonal gradient optimizers
- `coconut_grok_adapter.py`: Helper functions to easily adapt the COCONUT model
- `coconut_grok_example.py`: Example usage showing how to integrate and train with these optimizations

## Debugging Tips

If you encounter issues after integration:

1. **Loss becomes NaN**: This might indicate learning rate is too high. Try reducing lr to 5e-4 or 1e-4
2. **No improvement in generalization**: Ensure weight decay is properly set (between 0.01-0.001)
3. **Slow convergence**: The orthogonal gradient might slow initial convergence but should lead to better generalization. Try increasing learning rate slightly

## Performance Monitoring

To verify the optimizations are working as expected, monitor:

1. Training vs. validation accuracy gap over time
2. Weight norm growth
3. Logit magnitudes (these should remain reasonable with StableMax)
4. Cosine similarity between gradients and weights (should be low with OrthoAdamW)

#More Details of how to use the complete optimizers with COCONUT

I've created a set of optimizers based on the paper "Grokking at the Edge of Numerical Stability" to help the COCONUT model generalize (grok) earlier in training. The implementation addresses two key issues identified in the paper:

Softmax Collapse (SC): Implemented StableMax and StableCrossEntropyLoss to prevent numerical instability
Naïve Loss Minimization (NLM): Created OrthoAdamW optimizer that uses only gradient components orthogonal to weights
The files I've created are:

GrokOptimizers.py: Core implementation of StableMax and orthogonal gradient optimizers
coconut_grok_adapter.py: Adapter functions for easy integration with COCONUT
coconut_grok_example.py: Usage examples showing how to apply the optimizations
coconut_grok_integration.md: Detailed integration guide with specific modification points
coconut_grok_comparison.py: Benchmark script to demonstrate faster generalization
To use these optimizers with the COCONUT model, simply add one line before training:

from coconut_grok_adapter import configure_coconut_for_grokking
coconut_model = configure_coconut_for_grokking(coconut_model)
These optimizations should enable the model to generalize with fewer training epochs, even without heavy regularization, resulting in more efficient training.

To see the optimizers in action, you can run the comparison script:

python coconut_grok_comparison.py

#Update How the Grok optimization is included in the COCONUT Trainer Model: 

integrated the Grok optimizers from GrokOptimizers.py into COCONUTWLatentThinking.py. The changes include:

Replaced the standard Adam optimizer with OrthoAdamW:

Modified the optimizer creation in the apply_introspection_reward method to use the more numerically stable OrthoAdamW optimizer
OrthoAdamW only applies the component of the gradient that is orthogonal to the weights, preventing Naïve Loss Minimization and reducing the risk of numerical instability
Integrated StableMax throughout the attention mechanisms:

Added StableMax to the DecoderCrossAttention class with a custom stable_attention method that replaces standard softmax with StableMax
Modified SwitchingGateAttention to use StableMax for gate computations
Updated ByteEntropyPredictor to use StableMax for probability calculations
Replaced softmax with StableMax in the head weight normalization visualization code
Added a utility function for StableCrossEntropyLoss:

Created get_stable_loss_function() to make it easy to use the StableCrossEntropyLoss in various parts of the code
These changes maintain all the original functionality while improving numerical stability by:

Preventing weights from scaling in their current direction (which can lead to instability)
Using a more stable attention function that avoids numerical overflow/underflow
Making cross-entropy calculations more robust
The integration of Grok optimizers should help prevent softmax collapse, ensure more stable training dynamics, and potentially lead to faster "grokking" - the sudden improvement in model generalization during training.
