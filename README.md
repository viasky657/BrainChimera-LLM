# BrainChimera-LLM
 BrainChimera-LLM

Newest Edition of the Brain Chimera-LLM Program.
This is a work in progress attempt at creating a high-end LLM for local computar usage for robotics or businessess. (This project is no longer using Fmri data and it has been removed as it is no longer needed.)

# Ideas for further development 

- Personality Alignment
The Personality alignment may be integrated into this LLM to improve its ability to better align to tasks or target personas that would best preform for the user's tasks. This is the link to the original open source project: https://github.com/zhu-minjun/PAlign?utm_source=chatgpt.com. There may need to be ethical considerations for integrating this feature into this llm. 

- Sesame Voice AI for More Realistic AI Whisper-to-Model-to-Voice Response
The Sesame Voice AI would have a far more realistic interaction and audio output that better matches human speech and realtime generation than CosyVoice 2 framework (which is what this model currently uses). Sesame Voice also has more varied speech and language audio understanding which would be beneficial. I would like to intergrate this into the model in place of CosyVoice 2 once it releases on Github here: https://github.com/SesameAILabs/csm?tab=readme-ov-file.
