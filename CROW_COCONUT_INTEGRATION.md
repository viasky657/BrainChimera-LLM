# CROW Backdoor Elimination with COCONUT Binary Latent Architecture

This guide explains how to integrate the CROW (Consistency Regularization for backdOor elimination in Weights) method with COCONUT's binary latent architecture for enhanced model security and backdoor elimination.

## Introduction

The CROW backdoor elimination technique combined with COCONUT's dynamic binary patching provides a powerful approach for detecting and neutralizing backdoor attacks in language models. This integration leverages entropy-based patching rather than traditional tokenization, making it compatible with COCONUT's binary latent transformer architecture.

### Key Features

- **Entropy-Based Binary Patching**: Instead of using tokenizers, this integration uses entropy calculations to dynamically patch byte sequences.
- **Compatibility with COCONUT**: Works with COCONUT's binary patching architecture and latent transformer.
- **RedPajama Dataset Integration**: Uses the RedPajama dataset processed with entropy-based binary patching.
- **Adversarial Consistency Training**: Applies CROW's consistency regularization technique to binary latent models.

## How It Works

The integration works in several key steps:

1. **Entropy Prediction**: The system uses `ByteEntropyPredictor` to calculate the entropy (uncertainty) at each position in a byte sequence.
2. **Dynamic Binary Patching**: When entropy exceeds a threshold or changes significantly, a patch boundary is created.
3. **Binary Representation**: Byte sequences are converted to binary tensors for processing by the COCONUT model.
4. **Adversarial Training**: CROW generates adversarial perturbations and enforces consistency across transformer layers.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The simplest way to apply CROW backdoor elimination to a COCONUT model is:

```python
from Crow import apply_crow_to_coconut

# Apply CROW to COCONUT model
purified_model, metrics = apply_crow_to_coconut(
    coconut_model=your_coconut_model,
    max_chars=1000,         # Load 1000 characters from RedPajama
    epsilon=0.1,            # Perturbation magnitude
    alpha=5.5,              # Consistency weight
    learning_rate=2e-5      # Learning rate
)
```

### Advanced Usage

For more control over the process:

```python
from Crow import (
    ByteEntropyPredictor, 
    entropy_patching, 
    get_redpajama_binary_dataset, 
    CROWBackdoorElimination
)

# Get entropy predictor from your COCONUT model or create a new one
entropy_predictor = your_coconut_model.latent_transformer.entropy_predictor

# Create dataset with binary patching
binary_dataset = get_redpajama_binary_dataset(
    max_chars=1000,
    entropy_predictor=entropy_predictor,
    entropy_threshold=0.8
)

# Initialize and apply CROW training
crow_trainer = CROWBackdoorElimination(
    model=your_coconut_model,
    epsilon=0.1,
    alpha=5.5,
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    num_epochs=3
)

metrics = crow_trainer.train(binary_dataset)
```

## Key Components

### ByteEntropyPredictor

This component predicts the probability distribution of the next byte in a sequence:

```python
entropy_predictor = ByteEntropyPredictor(
    vocab_size=256,       # Byte vocabulary size
    hidden_size=512,      # Hidden dimension
    num_layers=4,         # Number of transformer layers
    num_heads=8,          # Number of attention heads
    ff_dim=2048           # Feed-forward dimension
)
```

### Dynamic Binary Patching

The entropy-based patching function segments byte sequences based on entropy thresholds:

```python
patches = entropy_patching(
    byte_sequence=your_byte_sequence,
    entropy_predictor=entropy_predictor,
    threshold=0.8,           # Global entropy threshold
    relative_threshold=0.1   # Relative change threshold
)
```

### Integration Example

For a complete working example, see `crow_coconut_integration_example.py`.

## Hyperparameters

The most important hyperparameters to configure:

| Parameter | Description | Default Value |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `epsilon` | Perturbation magnitude for adversarial examples | 0.1 |
| `alpha` | Weighting factor for consistency regularization | 5.5 |
| `entropy_threshold` | Threshold for entropy-based patching | 0.8 |
| `learning_rate` | Learning rate for parameter updates | 2e-5 |
| `num_epochs` | Number of training epochs | 3 |

## Visualization

The integration includes visualization tools to monitor training progress:

```python
from Crow import plot_crow_training_progress

# Plot training metrics
plot_crow_training_progress(metrics)
```

## Limitations

- The entropy-based patching approach might not be optimal for all types of text.
- Training might be computationally demanding for large models.
- The technique is most effective when the COCONUT model already uses the binary patching approach.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the integration:

1. **Verify the entropy predictor** is properly initialized and compatible with your model architecture.
2. **Check the patching thresholds** - too high may create very large patches, too low may create too many small patches.
3. **Ensure your COCONUT model** exposes the necessary components (binary_patch_module, latent_transformer, etc.).
