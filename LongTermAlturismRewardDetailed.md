The Long-Term Altruism Reward (R_{altruism_longterm}) component integration details into to the EpisodicMemory system, the COCONUT Latent model, and the MirrorNeuronEmpathyReward system. The implementation includes:

LongTermAltruismReward.py - A PyTorch module that:

Tags memories from the output phase with action_taken = True
Stores human feedback in the episodic memory system with proper timestamps and agent information
Retrieves relevant memories with feedback when calculating rewards
Computes rewards based on positive and negative feedback using configurable values
Appropriately weights and scales the rewards
Integration with MirrorNeuronEmpathyReward.py:

Added the component to the FullMoralRewardCalculator
Included hyperparameters for positive feedback value, negative feedback penalty, and reward scale
Modified the reward calculation to include the long-term altruism component
Proper metadata structure:

Implemented a flat metadata structure compatible with the EpisodicMemory system
Ensured all necessary information is stored: action flag, feedback type, source agent, timestamp, etc.
Tagged memories as "altruistic" for easy filtering and categorization
Documentation and testing:

Created comprehensive documentation in LongTermAltruismReward_README.md
Developed a test script in test_LongTermAltruismReward.py that validates the functionality
The Long-Term Altruism Reward component successfully leverages the episodic memory system to create a reward mechanism that reinforces altruistic behaviors over longer timescales. By storing and retrieving feedback on past actions, it enables the LLM to learn from human responses and develop more altruistic behavior through reinforcement learning.

This implementation follows the mathematical formula:
R_{altruism_longterm}(s, a) = feedback_reward_scale * (1/N) * Î£ (feedback_values)

With these changes, the system now has a complete Moral RL algorithm that includes all the specified reward components, promoting ethical and altruistic behavior in the language model over extended interactions.
