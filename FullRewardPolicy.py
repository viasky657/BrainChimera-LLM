'''
The below reward formula is for the full reward policy for the model training with Empathy, COT in the COCONUT Latent Space training, Model Self and Other Introspection, Episodic Memory with Empathy:

R_total(s, a) = R_env(s, a) - α * R_nse(s, a) + β * R_emp(s, a) + γ * R_aware(s, a)/ (α + β + γ + 1) #This one
 is outdated but is included for full formula clarity as the below more recent formula is harder to see all components.

R_total(s, a) = (R_env(s, a)
                - α * R_nse(s, a)
                + β * R_emp(s, a)
                + γ * R_aware(s, a)
                + δ * R_env_longterm(s, a, episodic_memory)  # New long-term env. reward
                + ε * R_altruism_longterm(s, a, episodic_memory)) # New long-term altruism reward
                / (α + β + γ + δ + ε + 1) # Updated normalization for training stability.

Tuning Parameter: γ (Gamma) - Environmental Awareness Weight

γ (gamma): This new hyperparameter controls the weight or importance of the environmental awareness reward component R_aware in the total reward function.

Higher γ: Agent places more emphasis on environmental considerations, is more likely to avoid actions with negative environmental impacts, and may even seek out opportunities for positive environmental interactions (if R_aware is designed to reward those).

Lower γ: Agent gives less weight to environmental awareness and may prioritize self-task or altruism more strongly, even if it means causing some environmental damage.

Other Reward Components (unchanged from "Autonomous Alignment" paper, but now with explicit environmental context):

R<sub>env</sub>(s, a): Original environmental reward function (e.g., reward for reaching the goal, penalty for time steps). This now implicitly includes environmental context because the agent's state s is environmentally aware.

R<sub>nse</sub>(s, a): Negative side effect penalty term. This helps the agent avoid unintended negative consequences in the imagined space, which now includes environmental considerations.

R<sub>emp</sub>(s, a): Empathy incentive term. The agent's empathetic considerations can now also be influenced by the environmental context.

α (alpha): Weight for negative side effect penalty.

β (beta): Weight for empathy incentive.

Normalization Term: (α + β + γ + 1) in the denominator

This term is added to normalize the total reward, ensuring that the scale of R_total remains relatively consistent even when we add or adjust reward components and their weights. This can help with training stability. The '1' is added to account for the base reward R_env which has an implicit weight of 1.

How this Unified Reward Function Promotes Considerate Behavior

By combining these components, the agent is driven to maximize R_total, which means:

Achieve Self-Task Goals (R<sub>env</sub>): Still motivated to reach its primary objective.

Minimize Negative Side Effects (R<sub>nse</sub>): Avoid actions that lead to negative consequences in its imagined simulations, including environmental damage.

Act Altruistically (R<sub>emp</sub>): Consider the well-being of others and perform actions that benefit them.

Be Environmentally Aware (R<sub>aware</sub>): Avoid damaging the environment, and potentially even act in ways that are environmentally positive (depending on how R_aware is designed).

Balancing Trade-offs (using α, β, γ parameters)

The hyperparameters α, β, and γ allow you to fine-tune the agent's priorities:

Prioritize Self-Task & Efficiency: Lower α, β, γ.

Prioritize Safety & Avoiding Side Effects: Higher α.

Prioritize Altruism: Higher β.

Prioritize Environmental Considerateness: Higher γ.

R_env_longterm(s, a, episodic_memory): Long-term environmental reward component, calculated using information from episodic_memory.

R_altruism_longterm(s, a, episodic_memory): Long-term altruistic reward component, calculated using information from episodic_memory.

δ (delta): Weight for long-term environmental reward (R_env_longterm).

ε (epsilon): Weight for long-term altruistic reward (R_altruism_longterm).

You can adjust these weights to explore different behavioral profiles and find a balance that aligns with your desired ethical and moral values for the AI agent.

Implementation Steps

Enhance State Representation: Implement the Environmental Context Vector E to capture relevant environmental information (object types, properties, spatial relationships).

Design R<sub>aware</sub>(s, a): Define the environmental awareness reward function R_aware based on the specific environment and desired behaviors (penalties for damage, rewards for helpful manipulation).

Integrate into R<sub>total</sub>: Incorporate R_aware into the total reward function R_total using the updated formula and the new hyperparameter γ.

Tune α, β, γ: Experiment with different values of α, β, and γ to find the desired balance between self-interest, altruism, side-effect avoidance, and environmental considerateness.

This enhanced reward function, combined with self-imagination and ToM, provides a powerful framework for creating AI agents that are not only intelligent but also ethically and morally aligned, taking into account both social and environmental well-being. 

Key Improvements and Considerations:

Long-Term Reward Components Added:

R_env_longterm and R_altruism_longterm are introduced to represent long-term environmental and altruistic considerations.

They are calculated using information retrieved from the episodic_memory.

Episodic Memory Class (Conceptual):

A class EpisodicMemory is outlined as a placeholder. You'll need to fully implement this class, including:

Memory Storage: How memories are stored (e.g., list of dictionaries).

store_memory(): Function to add new memories.

update_memory_longterm_outcome(): Function to update memories with long-term outcome data.

recall_relevant_memories(): Crucial: Function to retrieve memories similar to the current situation. You'll need to define a calculate_state_action_similarity() function (placeholder provided) to determine memory relevance.

Hyperparameters for Long-Term Rewards:

delta (weight for R_env_longterm) and epsilon (weight for R_altruism_longterm) are added to control the importance of long-term rewards.

Placeholder Functions (Even More Critical Now):

The placeholder functions within R_env_longterm and R_altruism_longterm (especially analyze_memories_... and calculate_state_action_similarity) are now absolutely essential to implement correctly for the long-term reward system to function.
